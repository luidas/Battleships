# Battleships game
## Details
The game is hosted on a Node.js server and all the communication is done through it.

## Requirements
The machine that is going to run the server should have Node.js installed.

## Usage
You should first start the server using the command line, 
```Node.js
	# node app.js [desired port number]
```
and then connect to it either from your own machine with the port provided. The game can only start when there are 2 players connected but you can place your ships while you are waiting for an enemy to connect.
